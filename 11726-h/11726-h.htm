    <h2>WEEK BY WEEK.</h2>

    <p>We understand that careful observers have noted a
    considerable amount of disturbance in the House of Commons
    during the past three weeks. Various reasons have, as usual,
    been advanced to account for this phenomenon, one eminent
    politician having gone so far as to hint darkly at the
    existence of Cave-men (or Troglodytes), who dwell in
    barrows.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The weather has been subject to strange variations. The mean
    temperature of the isothermal lines, when reduced to fractions
    of an infinitesimal value, has been found to correspond exactly
    to the elevation of the nap on the hat of a certain sporting
    Earl. Dividing that by the number of buttons on a
    costermonger's waistcoat, and adding to the quotient the number
    of aspirates picked up in the Old Kent Road on a Saturday
    afternoon, the result has been computed as equal to the total
    amount of minutes occupied by a vendor of saveloys in
    advertising his wares in the Pall Mall Clubs.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Candour is at times inconvenient. A prominent member of a
    Metropolitan Vestry was informed two days ago by one of the
    permanent scavengers of the district, that he "wasn't worth the
    price of a second-hand boot-lace." On inquiring the meaning of
    this curious phrase, he was told that "his blooming head would
    be knocked off for two-pence." We understand that the
    Vestryman's vote on a question of salary is responsible for the
    indignation of the scavenger, a member of a class usually noted
    for their somewhat ceremonious courtesy.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Those who propose to travel this year will doubtless be glad
    to learn that the Hessian fly has been observed in unusual
    abundance in Westphalia. This succulent <i>morceau</i> is now
    eaten fried, with a sauce of devilled lentils and oil.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It appears, after all, that there is no very definite
    foundation for the report that Sir EDWARD WATKIN is said to be
    disappointed in the competitive designs sent in for his Tower,
    because none of them provide sleeping accommodation for 2000
    people on the top storey. Of course something must have given
    rise to the rumour, but it is not easy to say exactly what. One
    competitor has already, however, it appears, intimated his
    readiness to make the required addition, by hanging his beds
    over the side of the Tower on "extended poles." The question
    is, "Would Sir WATKIN be able to induce his patrons 'to turn
    in' under such conditions?" There's the rub.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>STANLEY'S <i>Darkest Africa</i> (SAMPSON LOW) swamps all
    other books just now, except, of course, the Other STANLEY
    book, called <i>A Light on the Keep-it-Quite-the-Darkest
    Africa</i> (TRISCHLER &amp; Co.) which follows closely at its
    heels. The real STANLEY narrative is most interesting and
    exciting; it is a book that will make everyone "sit
    up"&mdash;at night to read it. The centre of attraction is in
    the answer to the question, "How did I find EMIN?" Which is,
    "Quite well, thank you."</p>

    <p>My faithful "Co." reports that he has been doing his duty
    nobly as a novel-reader. He has already devoured Vol. III. of
    the <i>Man with a Secret</i>. He would attack Vols. I. and II.
    if he had not had (so he says) quite enough of the Man
    <i>and</i> his Secret. <i>Innocent Victims</i> is written in
    the temperance interest. "Co." has every sympathy with the
    cause of undiluted water, but fears that this "story of London
    Life and Labour" may end in drink. He found it himself a little
    dry, and was not cheered by the name of the author, HUGH DOWNE,
    which seemed to suggest he could not get up again. He is
    eagerly waiting for more fiction, as "<i>Expiation</i>" by
    OCTAVE THANET has scarcely satisfied his craving for the weird
    and the horrible. In the meanwhile, he has found a cheerful
    interlude in <i>Sanity and Insanity</i>, a text-book (written
    in a popular yet scientific strain) of the maladies of the
    mind. He says, that Dr. MERCIER, the author, is to be
    congratulated on having treated a rather "jumpy" subject in a
    manner that can offend no one. "Co." had no idea up to now,
    that "t'other was so like unto which."</p>

    <p>All the Magazines for July are in, but the Baron has been
    unable to open them, and "Co." has cut them. BARON DE
    BOOK-WORMS &amp; Co.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>H.R.H.G.R.</i> You sent for me, <i>Mr. Punch</i>. I beg
    pardon, I should say, your Excellency?</p>

    <p><i>C.C.-in-C.</i> (<i>severely</i>). Be careful, Sir, and
    remember in whose presence you are! I believe about a month ago
    you asked for subscriptions in aid of the National Rifle
    Association?</p>

    <p><i>H.R.H.G.R.</i>. Yes, <i>Mr. P</i>.&mdash;I should say,
    your Excellency.</p>

    <p><i>C.C.-in C.</i> And I presume the N.R.A. have been put to
    very great expense in changing from Wimbledon to Bisley?</p>

    <p><i>H.R.H.G.R.</i> Yes, I am sorry to say
    so,&mdash;personally sorry. Although the bullets may have
    played the mischief with the adjoining property, still I
    think&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>C.C.-in-C.</i> (<i>severely</i>). We are not discussing
    Wimbledon now, Sir. Am I right in assuming that the reason
    funds were requested was to put Bisley in a proper condition
    for the reception of the Volunteers?</p>

    <p><i>H.R.H.G.R.</i> Of course. I am sure I am the best friend
    of the Volunteers, and&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>C.C.-in-C.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). How comes it then
    that when the Volunteers (whose own ranges are being closed all
    round London) ask for permission to shoot at Bisley, they are
    told that they may not have it, because "the range is required
    for the regular troops."</p>

    <p><i>H.R.H.G.R.</i> Well, as Commander-in-Chief, of course I
    must consider the Army, and as&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>C.C.-in-C.</i> President of the N.R.A., you should
    consider the Volunteers&mdash;but you don't! Now see here, if I
    hear any more of this sort of thing, I tell you frankly
    that&mdash;</p>

    <h2>THE RACK OF THE RATE-PAYER.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By a Victim of "Quinquennial Valuation."</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>"Parochial Authorities have a way of their own in
        interpreting Acts of Parliament, and a very peculiar way
        indeed of dealing with the Valuation Act.... Overseers go
        their own way, and interpret the Act according to their
        knowledge and experience; and in many cases experience is
        lacking, and knowledge an altogether unknown quantity....
        When dealing with leasehold property, overseers positively
        revel in the most delightful caprice. The leaseholder's
        property is dealt with kindly or the reverse, just as it is
        in this or that parish."&mdash;<i>James's Gazette</i>.</p>

    <p>"The Law of Arms is such."&mdash;Mr. Punch greatly regrets
    that he was unable to be present at the Annual Inspection of
    the Inns of Court Volunteers, when members were requested to
    "show every article of equipment and clothing of which they
    were in possession." No doubt the exhibition was as interesting
    as imposing. It is rumoured that the display of wigs and gowns
    (worn in Court) and lawn-tennis blazers (used in the Temple
    Gardens) was absolutely magnificent. It is further reported
    that the large collection of go-to-meeting hats, frock-coats,
    and patent-leather boots extorted universal admiration from all
    beholders. To his sorrow, a prior engagement prevented Mr. A.
    BRIEFLESS Junior, (who is an Hon. Member of the Corps), from
    putting in an appearance.</p>

    he'd struck it! he did look so disappointed, and so did that
    sweet horse!</p>

    <p><i>The Judge</i>. Serjeant SPANKER! (Sergeant S. <i>gallops
    in, spears the peg neatly, and carries it off triumphantly on
    the point of the lance, after which he rides back and returns
    the peg to the Assistants as a piece of valuable property of

    SPANKER&mdash;eight! (<i>Applause; the Assistants drive in
    another peg.</i>) Corporal CUTLASH! (Corporal C. <i>enters,
    strikes the peg, and dislodges without securing it. Immense
    applause from the Crowd</i>.) Corporal CUTLASH&mdash;two!</p>

    <p><i>The Gushing Lady</i>. Only two, and when he really did
    hit the peg! I do call that a shame. I should have given him
    more marks than the other man&mdash;he has such a <i>much</i>
    nicer face!</p>

    <p><i>A Child with a Thirst for Information</i>. Uncle, why do
    they call it <i>tent</i>-pegging?</p>

    <p><i>The Uncle</i>. Why? Well, because those pegs are what
    they fasten down tents with.</p>

    <p><i>The Child</i>. But why isn't there a tent now?</p>

    <p><i>Uncle</i>. Because there's no use for one.</p>

    <p><i>Child</i>. Why?</p>

    <p><i>Uncle</i>. Because all they want to do is to pick up the
    peg with the point of their lance.</p>

    <p><i>Child</i>. Yes, but why <i>should</i> they want to do
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Uncle</i>. Oh, to amuse their horses. (<i>The</i> Child
    <i>ponders upon this answer with a view to a fresh catechism
    upon the equine passion for entertainment, and the
    desirability, or otherwise, of gratifying it</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>A Chatty Man in the Promenade</i> (<i>to his</i>
    Neighbour). Takes a deal of practice to strike them pegs fair
    and full.</p>

    <p><i>His Neighbour</i> (<i>who holds advanced Socialistic
    opinions</i>). Ah, I dessay&mdash;and a pity they can't make no
    better use o' their time! Spoiling good wood, <i>I</i> call it.
    I don't see no point in it myself.</p>

    <p><i>The Chatty Man</i>. Well, it shows they can <i>ride</i>,
    at any rate.</p>

    <p><i>The Socialist</i>. Ride? O' course they can
    <i>ride</i>&mdash;we pay enough for 'aving 'em taught, don't
    we? But you mark my words, the People won't put up with this
    state of things much longer&mdash;keepin' a set of 'ired
    murderers in luxury and hidleness. I tell yer, wherever I come
    across one of these great lanky louts strutting about in his
    red coat, as if he was one of the lords of the hearth,
    well&mdash;it makes my nose bleed, ah&mdash;it <i>does</i>!</p>

    <p><i>The Chatty Man</i>. If that's the way you talk to him, I
    ain't surprised if it do.</p>

    <p><i>The Judge</i>. Sword <i>versus</i> Sword! Come in, there!
    (<i>Two mounted Combatants, in leather jerkins and black
    visors, armed with sword-sticks, enter the ring</i>; Judge
    <i>introduces them to audience with the aid of a flag</i>.)
    Corporal JONES, of the Wessex Yeomanry; Sergeant SMITH, of the
    Manx Mounted Infantry. (<i>Their swords are chalked by the
    Assistants</i>.) Are you ready? Left turn! Countermarch!
    Engage! (<i>The Combatants wheel round and face one another,
    each vigorously spurring his horse and prodding cautiously at
    the other; the two horses seem determined not to be drawn into
    the affair themselves on any account, and take no personal
    interest in the conflict; the umpires skip and dodge at the
    rear of the horses, until one of the Combatants gets in with a
    rattling blow on the other's head, to the intense delight of
    audience. Both men are brushed down, and their weapons
    re-chalked, whereupon they engage once more</i>&mdash;<i>much
    to the disgust of their horses, who had evidently been hoping
    it was all over. After the contest is finally decided, a second
    pair of Combatants enter; one is mounted on a black horse, the
    other on a chestnut, who refuses to lend himself to the
    business on any terms, and bolts on principle; while the rider
    of the black horse remains in stationary meditation</i>.) Go
    on&mdash;that black horse&mdash;go on! (<i>The chestnut is at
    length brought up to the scratch snorting, but again flinches,
    and retires with his rider</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>The Crowd</i> (<i>to rider of black horse</i>). Go on,
    now's your chance! 'It him! (<i>The recipient of these counsels
    pursues his antagonist, and belabours him and his horse with
    impartial good-will until separated by the Umpires, who examine
    the chalk-marks with a professional scrutiny.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>The Judge</i>. Here, you on the black horse, you mustn't
    hit that other horse about the head. (<i>The man addressed
    appears rebuked and surprised under his black-wired visor</i>;
    The Judge, <i>reassuringly</i>.) It's all <i>right</i>, you
    know; only, don't do it again, that's all! (<i>The Combatant
    sits up again.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>The Gushing Lady</i>. Oh, I can't bear to look on,
    really. I'm <i>sure</i> they oughtn't to hit so
    hard&mdash;<i>how</i> their poor dear heads must ache! Isn't
    that chestnut a <i>duck</i>? I'm sure he's trying to save his
    master from getting hurt&mdash;they're such sensible creatures,
    horses are! (<i>Artillery teams drive in, and gallop between
    the posts; the Crowd going frantic with delight when the posts
    remain upright, and roaring with laughter when one is knocked
    over</i>.)</p>

    <h4>DURING THE MUSICAL RIDE.</h4>

    <p><i>The Gushing Lady</i>. Oh, they're simply too
    <i>sweet</i>! how those horses are enjoying it&mdash;aren't
    they pets? and how perfectly they keep step to the music, don't
    they?</p>

    <p><i>Her Friend</i> (<i>who is beginning to get a trifle tired
    by her enthusiasm</i>). Yes; but then they're all trained by
    Madame KATTI LANNER, of Drury Lane, you see.</p>

    <p><i>The G.L.</i> What pains she must have taken with them;
    but you can teach a horse <i>anything</i>, can't you?</p>

    <p><i>Her Friend</i>. Oh, that's nothing; next year they're
    going to have a horse who'll dance the Highland Fling.</p>

    <p><i>The Socialist</i>. A pretty sight? Cost a pretty sight o'
    the People's money, I know that. Tomfoolery, that's what it is;
    a set of dressed-up bullies dancin' quadrilles on 'orseback;
    <i>that</i> ain't military manoeuvrin'. It's sickenin' the way
    fools applaud such goins on. And cuttin off the Saracen's 'ed,
    too; I'd call it plucky if the Saracen 'ad a gun in his 'and.
    Bah, I ate the ole business!</p>

    <p><i>His Neighbour</i>. Got anybody along with you, Mate?</p>

    <p><i>The Socialist</i>. No, I don't want anybody along with
    <i>me</i>, I don't.</p>

    <p><i>His Neighbour</i>. That's a pity, that is. A
    sweet-tempered, pleasant-spoken party like you are oughtn't to
    go about by yourself. You ought to bring somebody just to enjoy
    your conversation. There don't seem to be anybody '<i>ere</i>
    of your way of thinkin'.</p>

    <h4>DURING THE COMBINED DISPLAY.</h4>

    <p><i>The Gushing Lady</i> (<i>as the Cyclist Corps enter</i>).
    Oh, they've got a <i>dog</i> with them. Do look&mdash;such a
    dear! See, they've tied a letter round his neck. He'll come
    back with an answer presently. (<i>But, there being apparently
    no answer to this communication, the faithful but prudent
    animal does not re-appear</i>.)</p>

    <h4>AFTER THE PERFORMANCE.</h4>

    <p><i>The Inquisitive Child</i>. Uncle, which side won?</p>

    <p><i>Uncle</i>. I suppose the side that advanced across the
    bridges.</p>

    <p><i>Child</i>. Which side <i>would</i> have won if it had
    been a <i>real</i> battle?</p>

    <p><i>Uncle</i>. I really couldn't undertake to say, my
    boy.</p>

    <p><i>Child</i>. But which do you <i>think</i> would have
    won?</p>

    <p><i>Uncle</i>. I suppose the side that fought best.</p>

    <p><i>Child</i>. But which side was <i>that</i>? (<i>The</i>
    Uncle <i>begins to find that the society of an intelligent</i>
    Nephew <i>entails too severe a mental strain to be frequently
    cultivated.</i>)</p>

    unhappy mother still grander as acting. <i>Le
    Proph&egrave;te</i> is remarkable too, as being an Opera
    without Mlle. BAUERMEISTER in it. Skating scene, with a nice
    ballet, rather a frost. "Not sufficient go in it," observes
    veteran Opera-goer, with book in his hand, dated eighteen
    hundred and sixty something, containing a cast of characters
    which, he says, though he doesn't show me the book, comprises
    the names of MARIO, GRISI, VIARDOT-GARCIA, and HERR FORMES. A
    more veterany veteran tells me that GRISI and VIARDOT never
    played together in this, but that GRISI succeeded VIARDOT as
    <i>Fides</i>.</p>

    <p>Even the veteran is pleased, and acknowledges that thirty
    years ago they couldn't have done it as they do now, barring
    the skating scene, where, he insists upon it, the original "go"
    is wanting. The fact is, we have long passed the days when
    "rinking" was a novelty on the stage or off it. But what a
    jolly lot these Anabaptists were! They enjoyed themselves with
    their dancing-girls and their picnicking on the ice. Substitute
    General BOOTH for <i>Jean of Leyden</i>, and the tambourine
    girls for PALLADINO and the ballet, and then you have a modern
    version of <i>Le Proph&egrave;te</i>.</p>

    <p>Delightful to see M. MIRANDA as one of the three
    Anabaptists, <i>Mathisen</i> (a good name in the city, with
    only a letter changed), striking a sixteenth century flint, for
    the purpose of lighting a candle, but, failing in the attempt,
    compelled to destroy sixteenth-century illusion, and employ, in
    a sneaking kind of way, the nineteenth-century match, which
    strikes only on its own box. Mlle. NUOVINA, not so good here as
    in the part of <i>Marguerite</i>, but there is very little for
    a soprano to do. JEAN reckless in the final drinking song.</p>

    <p>The voice of DRURIOLANUS OPERATICUS is heard at the wings.
    The stage-manager's assistant is evidently nervous, and the
    curtain, after once going up a little way and coming down
    again, ascends suddenly, in spite of adjuration of DRURIOLANUS
    to "Wait! wait!" No hitch, and in another moment DRURIOLANUS,
    calm, but with suppressed emotion, is watching the scene from
    the front.</p>

    <p>"Ah," he murmurs to himself, "if I could only get Guildhall
    to do what I like in on that Ninth, of November when I shall be
    Lord Mayor. I'd soon show 'em what's what. I'd have a
    coronation, or investiture, scene to which this should be mere
    child's play."</p>

    <p>EDOUARD DE RESZK&Eacute; excellent as
    <i>Zacharias</i>&mdash;a, name chiefly associated with one of
    Lieutenant COLE'S characters, a Mawworm who looks over the
    screen; and M. MONTARIOL good as a lighter-hearted Anabaptist.
    A memorable revival.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;<i>Les Huguenots</i>. Return of Mlle.
    BAUERMEISTER after one night's absence.
    <i>Wednesday.&mdash;Carmen</i>, as before.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;<i>Rigoletto</i>. Fine house to hear
    this Opera. <i>Le Prince s'amuse</i>. The Princess also. Mlle.
    MELBA excellent; should be known as "Her Grace." M. LASSALLE,
    not ideal Jester, physically, but, vocally, never was
    <i>Rigoletto</i> better. Signor VALERO a good Ducal tenor: he
    scores a treble&mdash;(a thing to be done in whist and
    music)&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, treble <i>encore</i> for "<i>La Donna
    &egrave; Mobile</i>." Madame SCALCHI, of course, good as usual,
    and Signor MIRANDA (why not FERDINAND MIRANDA, and be
    thoroughly Shakspearian at once?) energetic as
    <i>Monterone</i>. FERDINAND MIRANDA always conscientious actor.
    Not last, but quite the least, comes Mlle. BAUERMEISTERSINGER,
    as <i>Giovanna</i>, without whom no Opera at Covent Garden can
    be considered as really complete. This is the only defect
    on</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>, in <i>Le Proph&egrave;te</i>, which is
    given again and again&mdash;no part for Mlle.
    BAUERMEISTERSINGER. Every place in the House taken. Profit here
    and Loss for those who can't get seats to hear it. Great
    excitement to know whether DRURIOLANUS is elected Sheriff or
    not. Early in the evening contradictory rumours in Lobby. At
    last the numbers are up. DRURIOLANUS elected. Uncommonly well
    he will look in his robes of office. DRURIOLANUS OPERATICUS
    COUNTI-COUNCILARIUS SHERIFFUS! All hail!</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Cannot be present. Have telegraphed

    <p>SARAH JEANNE of Arc. SARAH wrapt up in the visionary
    creation is comparatively lost in the part; that is, until she
    comes out magnificently in the last scene but one. Otherwise,
    except to look the Martyr, and to languish, nothing much for
    SARAH to do. Cathedral scene here rivals that at Covent Garden.
    SARAH wins and thrills the audience: her voice soothes them in
    their most ruffled humour, even after the audience has been
    kept waiting nearly twenty-five minutes between the Acts.
    Everyone disappointed that the funeral pile does not catch
    fire, and that the Curtain does not descend on a sensational
    scene, for which Captain SHAW and his Merry Men would have to
    be in attendance. The cast good all round, but it's more of an
    Opera, or a religious play, than a Melodrama. GOUNOD'S music
    not particularly striking, and the March sounds familiar. SARAH
    JEANNE holds the audience spell-bound to the end, rather by
    what she doesn't than by what she does, except in the great
    scene already mentioned. <i>Jeanne d'Arc</i> is to run on till
    further notice, and then Madame SARAH will appear in some of
    her well-known parts, and take a temporary farewell of the
    British Public. To those who have hitherto neglected
    opportunities of seeing SARAH JEANNE let this notice be a
    warning, and let them in their thousands hurry up to His
    Mayerjesty's.</p>

    <p>ERRATUM.&mdash;<i>Mr. Punch</i> last week paid the Notts'
    Cricketer, GUNN, a well-deserved compliment on his great
    innings of 228 against the Australians. He <i>intended</i> to
    represent him as piling-up that huge score "against the best
    bowling." The obviously accidental substitution of the word
    "batting" for "bowling" here, caused "the Nottingham Giant" to
    be credited with a novel cricketing performance, to which even
    <i>he</i> would hardly be equal. The proverbial Irish gun that
    could "shoot round a corner," would not be "in it" with a GUNN
    who could "bat against batting!" As a Correspondent (in
    slightly different words) suggests:&mdash;</p>

    a contrary effect. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is able to say, from

    <h3>TO THE EDITOR</h3>

    <h4><i>Of any Paper that inserts Gratuitous
    Advertisements.</i></h4>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Kindly contradict the rumour, which I find is
    widely spread and appears to be credited in some quarters, that
    an extensive sewage farm has been established in front of the
    most fashionable terrace in Slushborough-on-Sea, and that a
    Smallpox Hospital is about to be built upon the Pier.
    "Salubrious Slushborough" still continues (in spite of the
    machinations of jealous Northbourne) to be the most select,
    popular, and healthy resort on the British coasts.</p>

    <p>Yours disinterestedly, THE MAYOR OF SLUSHBOROUGH.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;A report (proceeding, I have reason, to believe,
    from ill-conditioned residents at Slushborough) is being
    disseminated to the effect, that the water-supply of
    Northbourne is largely tainted with typhus and diphtheria
    germs, and that an epidemic is already ravaging this place. As
    a matter of fact, the only case of illness of any kind in this
    town at present is a patient brought over from Slushborough in
    the last stage of blood-poisoning, owing to the defective
    drainage system there, and who, in this salubrious and
    invigorating atmosphere, is now rapidly recovering.</p>

    <p>I remain, Yours &amp;c., THE MAYOR OF NORTHBOURNE.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;In view of the correspondence with regard to the
    present condition of our popular seaside resorts, it will, I
    feel sure, interest your readers to learn that an examination
    of the air of Whitecliffe lately made by a local analyst,
    reveals the fact that it contains <i>fifty-five per cent. more
    ozone than is to be found on the top of Mont Blanc!</i> I
    publish this piece of intelligence purely in the interests of
    science, and as I am writing I may perhaps take the opportunity
    to mention that apartments here are both good and reasonable,
    and the bathing first-rate. The same analyst incidentally
    discovered that the air at Chorkstone is largely laden with
    poisonous bacteria.</p>

    <p>Yours truly, THE MAYOR OF WHITECLIFFE.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;At this time of year, when our glorious Lees are
    in the full radiance of their summer beauty, it becomes a mere
    act of Christian duty to warn intending holiday-makers to avoid
    Whitecliffe, and to select Chorkstone as their place of sojourn
    instead. An eminent local medical man asserts that morbiferous
    germs exist to a very dangerous degree in the Whitecliffe
    atmosphere, and that the Whitecliffe water is rendered almost
    solid by the multitude of bacilli it contains. Another
    Chorkstone resident, who lately visited Whitecliffe, found the
    air so relaxing that he fainted away, and had it not been for
    the kindness of the landlord of a certain hotel, who had him
    carried out of his bar and driven off in a trap to his own
    home, he believes he would have succumbed! Comment is
    needless.</p>

    <p>Yours impartially, THE MAYOR OF CHORKSTONE.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;There is not the slightest foundation for the
    ridiculous <i>canard</i> as to the inhabitants of this
    picturesque and abnormally fashionable town being "in a state
    of complete panic, owing to the fact that all the convicts
    recently confined at Shortland have broken out, and are
    indulging in frightful excesses in the neighbourhood." The
    convicts have <i>not</i> broken out; but an epidemic of
    gratuitous mendacity has done so, it appears.</p>

    <p>Yours indignantly, THE MAYOR OF CURDSMOUTH.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;Have you heard about the sanitary state of
    Shutmouth? Shocking!</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;As I hear that it is rumoured that M. PASTEUR has
    discovered an entirely new and most dangerous kind of bacillus
    in the neighbourhood of pine-trees, perhaps I may mention, in
    order to reassure our myriads of intending summer visitors,
    that the death-rate at this town is one in ten thousand, and
    that we should have had <i>no death-rate at all last week</i>,
    if the one person referred to had not met with an unfortunate
    accident. All the Shutmouth doctors are starving.</p>

    <p>Yours, THE MAYOR OF SHUTMOUTH.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;Ought not something to be done to check the
    mortality at Curdsmouth? It is disgraceful!</p>

            <p><i>Thalatta! Thalatta</i>! Not XENOPHON'S Greeks, O
            benevolent Public, but "Nobody's Boys,"</p>

            <p>Wild Arabs of London, by tenderness tamed, at the
            sight of the sea vent exuberant joys</p>

            <p>In vociferous shoutings! Imagine the rapture of
            wrecks from the gutter and waifs from the slum,</p>

            <p>When first on their ears falls the jubilant thrill
            of the sky-soaring lark, or the wild bee's low hum!</p>

            <p>Imagine the pleasure of plunging at will into June's
            leafy copses of hazel and lime,</p>

            <p>Of scudding through acres of grasses knee-high, and
            of snuffing the fragrance of clover and thyme.</p>

            <p>But what is all this to the dumb-stricken wonder,
            swift followed by outbursts of full-throated glee,</p>

            <p>Which fancy can picture, when London's pale outcasts
            from some grassy cliff catch first sight of the
            Sea!</p>

            <p><i>Thalatta! Thalatta</i>! There's many a lad who
            has never before had a glimpse of the wave;</p>

            <p>For these are of those who, from London's dark
            wastes 'tis the aim of their leaders to rescue and
            save.</p>

            <p>"Nobody's Boys," the lost waifs of the city,
            foredoomed, but for aid, to debasement and crime,</p>

            <p>Possible gallows-birds,&mdash;they with wan faces
            late cleansed from the rookery's hideous grime,</p>

            <p>Snatched from the gutter whilst boyhood bears hope
            with it, gathered and tended with vigilant care.</p>

            <p>Servants of soul-thrift their volunteer champions!
            Weeds of the slum, with fresh soil and sweet air,</p>

            <p>Grow into grace and fair fruitage. These pariahs,
            "Southwark Boys," strays from the slime-sodden
            east,</p>

            <p>FEGAN takes forth in gay troops to the meadows, in
            freshness of nature to frolic and feast,</p>

            <p>Climb in the woodlands and plunge in the waters,
            ramble and scramble through tangle-hedged lanes,</p>

            <p>Fish in the pools with youth's primitive tackle,
            breathe quickening vigour through bosoms and
            brains.</p>

            <p>Picture the boys "camping out" on the commons, and
            gipsying gaily in tents midst the heather,</p>

            <p>Armed with their canvas and blankets and boilers and
            pannikins well against hunger and weather.</p>

            <p>Picture them&mdash;CALLOT'S free brush might have
            managed it&mdash;gathered in pow-wow around the
            camp-fire,</p>

            <p>Sun-tanned and wind-browned, in picturesque raiment,
            with wisp of the wild hop or trail of the briar</p>

            <p>Hat-wreathed or button-holed. BURNS should have sung
            of them; trim-skirted Muse, with punctilious
            tastes,</p>

            <p>Were not at home with these waifs from the rookery,
            pastured at large in free Nature's wild wastes,</p>

            <p>Bounding, and breathing fresh air, romping,
            wrestling, and disciplined only to cleanness and
            order.</p>

            <p>Otherwise free as the tent-dwelling Arabs, or
            outlaws of Sherwood, or bands of the Border.</p>

            pictured it. Read it, all lovers of Nature and

            <p>Ere Spring returns, far Canadian homesteads will
            house their contingents of "Nobody's Boys."</p>

            <p>Let them take with them kind thoughts of Old
            England, and memories sweet of its rare rural joys.</p>

            plunge in the billow, and rove on the sands;</p>

            <p>Know the true British brine-whiff by experience.

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 23</i>.&mdash;A gleam of
    glory in sombre chamber of the Peers; a thin streak of red
    making its devious way between the table and the Benches. At
    the head comes Black Rod, giving some relief to the glittering
    spectacle; Garter King-at-Arms, without whom British
    Constitution would be a vain thing, follows. Then the Prince of
    WALES, looking a trifle anxious; is bringing out his son and
    heir to take his place in the hereditary chamber; anxious that
    all should go well. Next the new Duke of CLARENCE, looking very
    well in his new Peer's robes, on which his fair mother, seated
    with her daughter in side galleries, casts approving glance.
    Then the Duke of EDINBURGH, with the stalwart Hereditary Grand
    Marshal, Jockey o' Norfolk, and Aveland, Lord Great
    Chamberlain.</p>

    <p>Procession strolled in in quite casual way; passed Woolsack
    to which HALSBURY lent grace and dignity; New Peer handed his
    credentials to LOBD CHANCELLOR; but HALSBURY, above all things,
    man of cautious habits. No doubt everything was right and in
    order; presence of Prince of WALES guarantee of it; but
    HALSBURY not to be taken in. All very well, but all in due
    order. So new Peer taken charge of by the Reading Clerk;
    Procession moved on to table; documents mumbled over; oath
    taken; roll signed. New Peer turned to look at LORD CHANCELLOR;
    decidedly more friendly; haughty, forbidding, distrustful look,
    vanished from his ordinarily genial countenance. Young Peer
    encouraged to venture on friendly nod; LORD CHANCELLOR in
    response, lifted three-cornered hat, and on replacing it, was
    observed to cock it slightly on one side. Procession now moved
    on towards doorway by side of Throne, where was set three
    chairs.</p>

    <p>"A little slow isn't it, Sir," said Duke of CLARENCE to
    H.R.H.; "suppose we sit down here a bit; Black Rod will go and
    fetch us a flagon of Malmsey wine; am told they always keep a
    butt on the premises for stray Dukes."</p>

    <p>"No Malmsey for you, CLARENCE," said the Gracious Parent;
    "but if you'd like to sit down a moment, you may."</p>

    <p>So new Peer sat in middle chair, Father and Uncle anxiously
    regarding him. LORD CHANCELLOR slewed round on Woolsack to see
    what was going on behind him. New Peer, making himself quite at
    home, put on hat; finding LORD CHANCELLOR staring at him,
    uplifted it; LORD CHANCELLOR did same with his. Duke tried
    it</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"

             Preservation Bill, June 26</i>.&mdash;"They (the other
             Members of Parliament) could not go out and kill 300
             Dodos,"&mdash;but evidently <i>he</i> (Sir W.V.
             HARCOURT) could, and here he is&mdash;caught in the
             act!

    <p>again; LORD CHANCELLOR, comically half turned round on the
    Woolsack, followed suit.</p>

    <p>"Do it a third time, CLARENCE," whispered H.R.H., entering
    into fun of thing. So the new Peer, always with his eyes
    gravely fixed on LORD CHANCELLOR, who, in the excitement of the
    moment, had got his left leg cocked over the Woolsack, did it a
    third time; LORD CHANCELLOR did the same; Princesses in the
    Gallery sweetly smiling; Garter King-at-Arms totting off the
    number of salutes; and Black Rod thanking his stars that
    presently, when they left the House, he could walk face
    forward, not as when he visited the Commons, walking backward
    like a crab.</p>

    <p>"I think that'll do," said H.R.H. "HALSBURY is in very
    uncomfortable attitude; besides this is a sort of game that
    palls after the third round. Go and say good-bye to HALSBURY,
    and we'll go and have a cup of tea with your mother."</p>

    <p>Procession reformed; New Peer led up to Woolsack, where LORD
    CHANCELLOR, with little gesture of surprise, as if he had only
    now caught sight of him for first time, shook hands with him.
    Prince of Wales lifted his cap to LORD CHANCELLOR; LORD
    CHANCELLOR lifted his cap to Prince of WALES; the other Princes
    followed suit; Black Rod toddled off; and the gay and gorgeous
    procession disappeared through the doorway, leaving the Chamber
    in sudden twilight, as if the sun had dipped below the
    horizon.</p>

    <p>An exceedingly friendly meeting all round; quite
    contagious.</p>

        <a href="images/12-1.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="" /></a>"Toby, M.P., I presume?"
    </div>

    <p>"TOBY, M.P., I presume?" said BROADHURST, as I walked out.
    He had been looking on, and had quite caught the graceful
    manner of the LORD CHANCELLOR. I raised my hat three times, and
    went on to the Commons, where there were wigs on the Green.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;In Commons, Compensation Clauses
    withdrawn.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;TIM HEALY puts final spoke in wheel of
    Compensation Bill. Rose after questions on paper disposed of,
    and asked for ruling of SPEAKER on an important point affecting
    Parliamentary Procedure. TIM'S manner boded ill for the
    Government&mdash;deferential, low-voiced, with total absence of
    self-assertion or aggression, TIM stood, the very model of a
    modest young man.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Prince ARTHUR, "but I hope he's not going to
    say anything about Irish business. When he's in this mood, I
    prefer he should address himself to my dear friend JOKIM."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/12-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/12-2.png"
             alt="" /></a><i>Right Hon. A. Balfour</i>. "My dearest
             Tim, 'for this relief much thanks!'"
    </div>

    <p>TIM had anticipated Prince ARTHUR'S wishes. It <i>was</i>
    about Compensation Bill that he desired to consult SPEAKER.
    JOKIM, as last turn in devious course, had proposed to dodge
    difficulty about Compensation by accumulating proceeds of
    increased till some indefinite period, when great reform of
    Licensing should be introduced. "But," says TIM, almost begging
    pardon for interposing, "in Budget Bill it has been
    specifically decreed that proceeds of tax should be
    appropriated during present Session." Accumulation, TIM urged,
    with a vague notion that he was dropping into poetry, is not
    Appropriation. SPEAKER agreed with him: consternation on
    Treasury Bench; Ministers tried to put bold face on affairs;
    could not discuss question now; would do so by-and-by;
    confident they could show there was nothing in TIM'S objection.
    An hour later, when time came to resume Committee on
    Compensation Bill, OLD MORALITY announced that it would be
    postponed to give Ministers opportunity to consider point
    suggested by TIM. Shout of exultation went up from Opposition
    Benches: prolonged fight had been won at last; the obnoxious
    Bill was floored, and TIM had done it.</p>

    <p>OLD MORALITY, standing at table in attitude where natural
    nobility of character struggled with accidental depression,
    said: "Success, Mr. SPEAKER, is a mark no mortal wit of surest
    hand can always hit. For whatsoe'er we perpetrate, we do but
    row; we are steered by fate, which in success often
    disinherits, for spurious causes, noblest merits. Great
    occasions, Mr. SPEAKER, are not always true sons of great and
    mighty resolutions, nor, I may add, do the boldest attempts
    bring forth events still equal to their worth. That may be the
    case with us; but at least we shall carry to our homes the
    consciousness that we have diligently striven to do our duty to
    our QUEEN and our country." General cheering at this little
    speech, and scarcely dry eye on Treasury Bench.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Compensation Bill in fresh
    difficulties.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Sitting remarkable for two speeches
    from ordinarily silent Members. Began and ended proceedings.
    First was by WHARTON, on presenting petition signed by over
    half a million persons in favour of Compensation Clauses of
    Licensing Bill. Petition brought down in three cases by
    PICKFORD'S van. Conveniently disposed on floor of House;
    occupied the whole space. Perturbation on Treasury Bench at the
    report that there was Royal Commission going forward in other
    House. Time of the Session when these are frequent. Black Rod
    arrives; requests attendance of Members to hear Commission
    read. Advances towards table, bowing to chair; retires
    backward; SPEAKER follows him. How would it be to-day, with
    floor blocked with towering cases? Black Rod an old sailor,
    might haul himself up hand-over-hand, and skip across tops of
    cases; but never do for the SPEAKER so to scramble out. Hasty
    and anxious inquiry made. Turned out to be no Royal Commission
    to-day; so new disaster for Ministers avoided.</p>

             alt="" /></a>A Maiden Speech.
    </div>

    <p>WHARTON succeeds somehow when presenting Petition in casting
    sort of Cathedral Close air over proceedings. Life-long
    association with cathedrals and their precincts have invested
    him with placid charm of manner: would have made an excellent
    Dean; gone off capitally as a Canon; now, as he waves his hand
    towards the space lately crowded by the Petition, wears subtle,
    indescribable, but unmistakable air, as if he were taking part
    in a Confirmation Service.</p>

    <p>The other orator, GRIMSTON, considerably less ecclesiastical
    in his manner. Appeared suddenly on scene at midnight: maiden
    speech; very effective. "Mr. COURTNEY, Sir," he said,
    diffidently hiding his hands in his trousers' pockets, "I claim
    the indulgence the House always extends to young Members, in
    rising to address it for the first time. I beg to move that the
    question be now put," Question put accordingly; debate
    Closured, and so home.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Quite a lot. Licensing Clauses
    finally dropped; Allotments Bill read Third Time; Barracks Bill
    through Committee.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Police in possession of House to-night.
    MATTHEWS moved Second Reading of Bill dealing with Force. Quite
    unusual consensus of approval, considering it is a Government
    Bill. Only for GEORGE CAMPBELL, chorus would have been
    unanimous. But GEORGE, looking in from Zanzibar, where he had
    called after a brief trip through Jerusalem and Madagascar,
    denounced the measure as "thoroughly bad." House thereupon
    passed Second Reading without division.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Police Bill read Second
    Time.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"The Oof Bird" is the Auk, as <i>Cornhill Mag.</i> says its
    eggs cost &pound;170 apiece,&mdash;of course when fresh. What a
    big lark!&mdash;Yours, 'ARRY.</p>
    <hr />

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
